# Overview

This is a website that I made that serves as a portfolio of all the projects that I have done so far. It was built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-0/#gatsby-cli) a React.js based framework. I chose Gatsby primarily due to the ability of being able to deploy the website directly through them as well as their advertised faster load and build speeds.

As all of my previous projects were mainly focused on writing scripts to automate mundane everyday tasks or solving Leetcode questions, it was definetly a challenge to dive into a frontend project which involed both designing a website that would look reasonably visually pleasing and actually implementing it. Although I had some previous experience with HTML and CSS, it was not to this extent and finishing this project was definetly a lot of fun and I certainly learned a lot.

## Key Takeaways

- **Have a design in mind**  
Having a rough sketch of what I wanted my website would look like beforehand would have definetly helped saved hours of changing the layout and pages around to what I wanted.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

- **Avoid one CSS file**  
When I started, I styled all the components and pages on my website from one `main.css` file and things got messy really quickly as my website got bigger and more complicated. I found myself scrolling through 100s of lines of CSS to change the style of one component and fixing conficting class names.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

- **A website is naturally Responsive**  
Responsiveness is not something that even crossed my mind when I created the first iteration of my website. Only upon viewing the website on my mom's laptop, did I realize that all of my components were squished together and it did not look at all similar to what I was seeing on my moniter.  
Learning that I was the one making the website unresponsive by adding restrictive CSS, such as fixing the size of an image to a certain number of pixels, really helped me make the site more functional across a variety of screens.

## Things to improve

- **Load times**  
Although the [Lighthouse Report](https://build-c8d14efc-8ab0-43ce-ae1e-4ce9a223a1e4.gtsb.io/reports/lighthouse/index.html) provided by Gatsby puts the time for the site to be fully interactive to 4.1 seconds, I noticed that on older machines and with a cleared browser cache, the site takes significantly longer to load.  
While I am not entirely sure on how to remedy this at the moment, I am determined to find out what I can do to make it better.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

- **Extend Responsiveness**  
Currently, while the site works reasonably well across the most commonly found laptop and desktop screens, it breaks down when viewing it on screens smaller than `1360x800px`.  
That's definetly something that I would like to remedy moving forward and make it more accesible to smaller laptop screens and even mobile phones.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

- **Add a loading screen**  
While adding a loading screen to a website does not seem that complicated, the way the site is structed with its smooth scrolling feature makes it way harder than it needs to be. To solve this I would probably need to rework the entire site and implement the scrolling feature in some other way.
